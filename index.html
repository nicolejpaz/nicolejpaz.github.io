            <p><a href="http://fremote.tv/">Fremote:</a> Watch videos simultaneously!<br>
              Fremote is a web app to remote-control YouTube & Vimeo videos. A user can send a link to a friend(or friends) they are chatting with and they can watch the video/movie at the same time. Whoever has control of the "remote" can start/pause/fast-forward/rewind the video and it will control the video for every viewer.

            <h4>Actually Has Code on Github</h4>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/nicolejpaz/diary_tracker">Diary Tracker</a>: Have you ever had a medical issue where your doctor had you keep a diary? If so, do you remember bringing it back to the doctor and having them take their time to skim its entire contents? Well, this intends to solve that issue &mdash; at least in regard to sleep diaries &mdash; by having the user fill out a form once a day. It only checks for sleep length and quality, but I intend to include a textbox for the user to describe their sleep patterns. These are then put on a summary page, which the user can then show to their doctor. The textbox will take some more time because it'll be a word cloud on the summary page, and will eventually allow the user to sort through the cloud (i.e., only show words that appeared when the quality of sleep was ranked 'Zombie').</p>

            <h4>Currently Planning</h4>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/nicolejpaz/new_pitch_racer">Pitch Battle</a>: This will pit two users against one another in a pitch battle. Basically, two users go to the same link. On that page, there is a musical note. They have to then sing that note, and they get points for accuracy. The person with the most points wins the battle.</p>

        <h2>Non Coding Projects</h2>
        <section id="non-code">
          <p>Music!: I'm a huge music nerd. I play quite a few instruments, from the piano to the mountain dulcimer. I also collect instruments, so please keep me away from any music shops for my own safety. Especially the accordion music shop in Oakland; I think my roommate would kill me.</p>

          <p>Silicone Molding: Am learning how to create molds in order to create cool objects.</p>

          <p>Writing the Next Great American Novel: Okay, I'm not, but it's a novel about an invisible person (literally invisible) whose only contact with the world is through the internet.</p>

          <p>Writing Another Novel: It's a work that's about a woman who finds a father and daughter team who are running away from a cult. The father was involved in the cult since birth, and they have to work together to stop it, as well as heal the damage caused by the family's past experiences. (Better than it sounds, I swear!) The woman is a programmer in the 80's, and it required a good deal of research into everything from COBOL to phone phreaking.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NWA-Game-Developer-Group/">NWA Game Developer Group</a>: Collaborated to make a video game. Said game never launched.</p>

          <p>CATV: Created graphics and edited video for a local access television program.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <section id="hobbies">
          <p>Music, crafts (sewing, knitting, needlework, crochet, leatherworking etc), molding, (hoping to) play with Raspberry Pi, minor dabbling in electronics and robotics, drawing, painting, programming, writing, playing with assorted Linux distros (I once installed Ubuntu on a MacBook, meaning I had to work around EFI before it was cool).</p>
          <p>Basically, I love working with my hands. I've done my own home renovations in the past, and am aching to work on my car. I've also replaced parts in my computers.</p>
